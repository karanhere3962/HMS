# HMS
Hotel Management System

This para is just about my personal feelings attached to this project. You can skip this if you want, but, I would appreciate your read.

This is my second project in c++ (the first was sudoku creator and solver, but I lost its source code :( . But your can ask my teacher for confirmation :D), and my first big try at creating something a little more complex. 
This project uses everything that I had learnt till then - pointers, linked list, double linked list (I had to invent this then), object oriented programming, file systems, etc, and somethings that I had to find out for myself. One of them included creating GUI in command line program. This was supposed to be a 5 marks project for my 12th standard finals, and inspite of repeated warnings from my cs teacher, I spent most of my time creating this beauty. At the end, my teacher was really impressed with the work I had done. Therefore, this project is really close to me. P.S. - I think I would have scored better if this project wasn't constantly on my mind :P .
